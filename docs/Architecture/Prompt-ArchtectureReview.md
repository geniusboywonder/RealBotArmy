think hard and research widely.

assume the role in the attached md. Review this archtecture document and critically analyse it for gaps or bad design. the architecture needs to run on free, open-source and cloud-based solutions. it needs to be lightweight with low complexity. Summarise your feedback into a md document for download making suggestions to improve areas, technology and tools that you dont agree on.

*********************

As the architect defined earlier in this chat, consider the updated BotArmy Technical Architecture Document. Taking into account the reviews attached, summarise the ares where there is a majority consensus on the area/issue, even if the suggested tools/approach differ. Summarise the key areas that you believe require focus or rework. If there are points of agreement or majority consensus include those too.

Either defend your choice of architecture, or change it to support the goals of a simple, lightweight, free, oss, cloud-based solution with low complexity.

For speed of delivery in the POC, I ideally want a solution that caters for the code, test, deploy and rendering of the solution on a single (free) platform. You can note where the POC and final solution may differ, noting both tech choices.
